164,12,"If a merchant asks “Debit or Credit?” when you make a purchase, you can choose either one and your purchase will be subtracted from your primary checking account. • If you select Debit, you must also enter your PIN. • If you select Credit, you may have to provide a signature except for some smaller amounts and when paying for self-service fuel. g. ATM safety and safeguarding your account informationBe safe at ATMs. Some ATM locations are recorded by a surveillance camera or cameras. We advise you to be aware of your surroundings before, during and after any ATM use. Here are some additional tips: • Choose an ATM that is well lit. • Don’t use an ATM that looks unusual or altered. • During the hours of darkness, consider having someone accompany you to the ATM. • If you suspect the ATM isn’t working properly or if you notice anything suspicious, cancel the transaction and ﬁnd another machine. • When using a Chase ATM with a separate entry door, you should close the door completely upon entering and should not permit entrance to any unknown person after regular banking hours. • If you need emergency assistance as a result of criminal activity or medical emergency, contact 911. • At a walk-up ATM, minimize transaction time by having your card ready to use. At a drive-up ATM, keep your car engine running and lock your doors. • Stand between the ATM and anyone waiting to use the machine or cover your hand so others can’t see your PIN or the transaction amount. • As soon as your transaction is complete, remove your card from the ATM, and then put away your money, receipt, and card. • Contact the police or a security officer if you see any suspicious activity at the ATM. If you think you’re being followed, go to a heavily populated, well lighted area, and immediately contact the police. • Complaints concerning security at New York Chase ATMs should be reported to the Chase Security Department at 1-800-900-0001 or the New York State Department of Financial Services at 1-888-697-2861. Keep your PIN confidential. Never give your PIN to anyone, and don’t write it down. In addition, to keep your card information safe: • Use a PIN that others can’t easily ﬁgure out. • To change your PIN (or if you forget your PIN), request a new PIN at chase.com, call us or visit any Chase branch. Protect your debit card or ATM card as you would a credit card or cash. Notify us immediately if your card is lost or stolen, or if you discover any other error.
